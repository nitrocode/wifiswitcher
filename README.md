# WifiSwitcher - WIP

A free and open source (FOSS) app to switch your wifi between previously saved wifi configurations based on a number of settings. This solution was created to solve my own issue around the house where I would be connected to Wifi A on one side and move to the other side and have to manually switch to Wifi B. This app automates that and uses inspiration from apps found on the Google Play store, notably SWIFI.
